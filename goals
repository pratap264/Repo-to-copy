1) I think like a customer:

In my recent GIG JOB i have used my customer centric midset for developing UI part for ease to use.

2) I own it - i always search for better resources in terms of referral for my company's Growth & well being , When I faced with challenges, I do not shy away from them but rather I instead tackles them head-on with determination or go out of my way to help co-workers.

3) I say what I need to say - when i see any problem or blocker i always ready to communicate with them to solve and help.

4) I act decisively and get things done -  For API Team we have  got new Capgemini contact absed Associate for api development , so it was my responsibility to get things done from them so i have helped them to get onboarded and get things setting up like installing softwares accers , requests KT sessions , project overview etc.
