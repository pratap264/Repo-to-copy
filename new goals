Customer-Focused Thinking: In my recent GIG job, I emphasized a customer-centric approach, particularly in developing the user interface. My focus was on creating an easy-to-use and intuitive UI, keeping the customer's perspective and needs at the forefront.

Taking Ownership: I proactively seek better resources and referrals that can contribute to the company's growth and well-being. When confronted with challenges, I donâ€™t shy away. Instead, I address them with determination and a proactive attitude. Additionally, I am always willing to extend my support to colleagues whenever they need it.

Effective Communication: Whenever I encounter a problem or obstacle, I am always prepared to communicate openly and work towards finding solutions. My approach is to actively engage in dialogue to address and resolve issues promptly.

Decisive Action and Execution: Recently, the API Team welcomed a new Capgemini contract-based associate for API development. It was my responsibility to ensure their smooth integration into the team. To achieve this, I assisted them with the onboarding process, including setting up software, accessing necessary resources, arranging knowledge transfer sessions, and providing an overview of the project. My goal was to ensure they were well-equipped to contribute effectively to our team's work.
