Delivery Accountability: I have been involved in team planning, ensuring proper builds with minimal defects. My learning from the API team includes agile processes such as reporting progress, identifying obstacles, and requesting support during scrum calls. I've maintained Transunion coding standards for our specific technologies and adhered to the estimates set during PI planning.

Process Accountability: As a newcomer, I have concentrated on professional and personal upskilling. This includes completing mandatory training and compliance requirements on time, learning and applying Transunion coding standards, and enhancing my skills in DevOps and cloud technology, as evidenced by my completion of the TU Cloud Training and participation in the AWS Game Day Event. Additionally, I've been involved in learning and implementing CI/CD pipelines with my team, a process that has significantly contributed to my future readiness and aligns with my personal learning goals.

Technology Accountability: Initially joining the API team, I contributed by creating documentation for new joiners and detailing project specifics in Confluence. I also assisted Capgemini contract associates with their onboarding to the API team, including software setup, access provision, and problem-solving. As I grew more familiar with the API projects and their requirements, I began assisting with CI/CD pipeline tools and development on the SIT server. Supporting the team in both technical and non-technical aspects has been fulfilling, and I have gained valuable knowledge in Azure DevOps, CI/CD, agile processes, vulnerability scans, and deployment, which will be beneficial in my career progression.

Engagement in GIG Jobs: This year, I completed my first GIG job, named CV GAME DAY. It was a rewarding experience as I quickly learned new technologies and applied them effectively. I also aided a teammate in understanding and solving project requirements, ensuring the task was completed within the set timeline. This initiative involved implementing a base setup using Angular for the frontend and .NET for the backend, providing me with significant industry experience and technological knowledge.

Project Support Under F1 Operating Model: Assigned to the SA API Team, I rapidly adapted to the team's requirements, learned the necessary technologies, and started contributing effectively. My work on both functional and non-functional aspects has been instrumental in helping the API team meet its objectives. I am proud to have supported the team in meeting its deadlines and feel that my experience with the API team, in both technological and soft skills, will be highly beneficial for my future endeavors.
