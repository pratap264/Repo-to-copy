Achieving Certifications via TU Learning Platform: Throughout this year, I have successfully completed several certifications from Cloud Guru and LinkedIn Learning. The courses I accomplished include 'Introduction to AWS', 'Introduction to GCP & Azure', and 'DevOps Concepts'. Additionally, I have attained a C# Certification from Microsoft. These certifications have been instrumental in my growth through 2023 and will continue to benefit me in the future.

Personal Learning Plan: I have formulated a personal development plan and am proud to have successfully completed it before the end of the year. My learning journey included topics such as API Development, .NET Core, PostgreSQL, REST APIs, and development standards. I have focused on implementing best coding practices. Looking forward to 2024, I am excited to continue my learning and further develop my skills.
