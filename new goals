These certifications have been instrumental in my growth through 2023 and will continue to benefit me in the future.

Personal Learning Plan: I have formulated a personal development plan and am proud to have successfully completed it before the end of the year. My learning journey included topics such as API Development, .NET Core, PostgreSQL, REST APIs, and development standards. I have focused on implementing best coding practices. Looking forward to 2024, I am excited to continue my learning and further develop my skills.


When I first joined, I was assigned to the SA API team in a vital position. I am proud to have successfully met the requirements of this role. Beyond my learning experiences, I have completed significant tasks such as logging, monitoring, issue resolution, and BAU (Business As Usual) tasks.

My contributions include creating documentation for new joiners and detailing project specifics in Confluence. I have consistently completed assigned tasks, which has strengthened my understanding of API and .NET Core Web API concepts. Supporting the team in both technical and non-technical areas has been rewarding, and I have acquired valuable knowledge in Azure DevOps, CI/CD, agile processes, vulnerability scans, and deployment. All of these are crucial for my career advancement.

Looking forward to 2024, my main focus will be on further upskilling. I aim to enhance my existing skills and learn new ones, applying them effectively in my work. This continuous learning and development will undoubtedly aid in my future career growth.



When I first joined, I started with no prior knowledge, but the SA API team and the Transunion Internship were instrumental in kick-starting my journey. The experience I gained from them has been invaluable.

I learned essential technologies from scratch, including .NET, PostgreSQL, REST APIs, Angular, Azure DevOps, and CI/CD. Additionally, I acquired soft skills such as understanding the agile process and effective communication. Since 2023, I have developed significantly, transforming into a full-stack developer ready to take on projects, gig jobs, or any new initiatives.

Looking ahead to 2024, my goal is to further strengthen my abilities as a full-stack developer. I plan to obtain AWS and Azure certifications and deepen my knowledge in Angular and ReactJS. Moreover, I am interested in learning Python for backend development. I believe in implementing each new skill in personal projects as a practical way to test and learn, which is beneficial for my professional career.

I pursue certifications that align with the technologies I need for my projects. Additionally, I engage in problem-solving exercises that help fortify my skills, preparing me for more advanced challenges in my career.
